The kubectl command line tool is an extremely extensive and powerful utility. 
It has many uses, but for this hands-on lab, we will be using it to familiarize ourselves with the Kubernetes cluster in order to find out more information about how the cluster is built. 
After completing this lab, we will have a hands-on understanding of how to move about the cluster and check on the different resources and components of the Kubernetes cluster.

1. Use the following command to list the nodes in your cluster:
kubectl get nodes

2. Use the following command to list the pods in all namespaces:
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces

3. Use the following command to list all the namespaces in the cluster:
kubectl get namespaces

4. Use the following command to list the pods in the default namespace:
kubectl get pods

5. Use the following command to find the IP address of the API server:
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide

6. Use the following command to check for any deployments in the cluster:
kubectl get deployments --all-namespaces

7. Use the following command to view the label on the etcd pod:
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --show-labels -o wide
