Cluster Architecture:

Kubernetes Master:
===================
The kubernetes Mater is made up of 4 main services that help maintain the control plane
* API Server - This is the communication hub for all cluster components. It exposes the kubernetes API.
* Scheduler - Assigns your application to a worker node. It auto-detects which pod to assign to which node based on resource-requirements and hardware constraints.
* Controller Manager - Maintains the cluster. Handles node failures, replicating components, and maintains the correct number of pods.
* etcd - Data store that stores the cluster configuration

NOTE** Master node can be replicated for high availability.

Kubernetes Worker:
==================
The worker node has three main components
* Kublet - Runs and manages the containers on the node and talks to the API Server
* Kube-proxy - Load balances traffice between application components.
* Container Runtime - The program that runs your containers
